### Hi, I’m Jim👋  

Software developer, ML/AI enthusiast, and ex-Google engineer. Passionate about AI-driven web development and open-source innovation.  

Currently building [**WebSynthAI**](https://github.com/websynthai/WebSynthAI), a tool that lets crypto projects launch fully functional websites from a single prompt—no coding required. Exploring the intersection of **AI, web automation, and crypto** to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

### 🏆 Why Now?  
With major figures like **Donald Trump launching meme coins** like **$TRUMP**, the need for professional websites in crypto has never been greater. **WebSynthAI** helps projects stand out and get online fast—ensuring you don’t fall behind in this fast-moving space.  

As part of this launch, I’m also introducing **$WebSynthAI** on the **Solana network**, designed to complement WebSynthAI’s ecosystem.
